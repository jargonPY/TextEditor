# Text Editor

A text editor similar in style to the vi editor (albeit not as many features).
Instructions to run the editor:
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Open the cloned directory in the terminal and type: `g++ ./src/*.cpp -g  -I ../include -o ../bin/editor`
  3. Once compiled type -- `./bin/editor` -- to run editor
  4. Enjoy!
