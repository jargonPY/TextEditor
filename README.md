A text editor similar in style to the vi editor (albeit not as many features). https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo helped me with many of the terminal commands.

Instructions to run the editor:
  1. Clone the repo
  2. Compile and link all files in the src folder (alternatively you can run the compiled file in the bin folder if you are comfortable running an executable)
  3. Run the executable
